"An app for archiving customers and notes about them"

The current application is running locally and is responsible for archiving customer's data. The specific features are the following ones:

Create customer / Read customer / Update customer / Delete customer (CRUD actions) Change password Login / Logout When the app is running, the first time experience view is a panel in which the user needs to insert the proper password. Then, after a successful login process, the user can choose from the next options:

Check the list of all Customers [1] Check your notes [2] Change password [3] Logout [4] If the user is going to click on the first option [1], is going to view all the existing customers inside a list. From that view, the user can also delete or add a new one. Secondly, if the user is going to click on the Check your notes [2] option, a detailed text area is going to be visible with detailed information for each customer. The specific area is also editable and thus the user can edit any kind of information needs to be made. Finally, the Change password [3] and Logout [4] options are clear for what their functionality does.

In order to save all the above information, .txt format files have been used as a data base (all the following files are saved under the directory named as 'Base'). Thus, a file named as 'Allcustomers.txt' is responsible for saving the name of the customers from the list. Additionally, each customer has its own txt file with its detailed information/data. Also, there is a file named as 'Password.txt (under a different directory named as 'Password') in which the password of the user is saved.

Note1: For the FTE the directories for the user do not exist and that's why some exceptions may occur. Though, the needed directories will be created automatically.

Note2: For the FTE the password is going to be empty. So, the user can enter the app by just clicking on the 'Login' button or by clicking the ENTER button.
